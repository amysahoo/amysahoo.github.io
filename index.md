## Get to Know Me
I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelors in Buisness Administration. My area of focus is in Risk Management, but I also obtained a communications minor. My hobbies include hiking with my dog, tennis, reading, painting, and tactile crafts such as rug- making and embroidery. I spend a lot of my free time volunteering in my community in programs such as Best Buddies, Special Olympics, Nuci's Space, and the public library.

## Projects
This section is all of the major projects I have completed in recent years, this includes insurance/ risk analysis case studies I completed on buisnesses, marketing strategies/techniques and cultural evaluations, as well as another website I created to showcase some of my art. In order to access the projects they have been uploaded as a pdf, so just click the link to download them. 

### Risk Management 5100S Buisness Analysis
This project is probably the most "hands- on" project i've ever done. In this project my team and I did an analysis on current buisness operations for a local Athens diner known as "The Grill". In order to create this evaluation, we had to obtain the restaurant's previous insurance policies and assess their current buisness operations and how they could reduce the perils (and risks) associated with each operation.

### Corporate Risk Management 5950 Case Study 
This project Assessed a companyâ€™s Risk Identification and Valuation, based on their previously existing direct property, indirect property, liability and personal risk policies. Also created a Risk Treatment plan in order to combat any issues that were found during the assessment.

### Social Media Marketing Strategy 
This is my favorite project I have created because it allowed me to display my creativity within the project. I had to assess Hard Rock Cafe's competitors and create a new concept for their buisness that could boost sales. I had to do a cost analysis for this proejct as well and how much the company would actually profit from this implementation. This was a very time- consuming project given that I only had a few weeks to complete this individual project.

### Multicultural Marketing


### Introduction to Technology
This class was one of the most beneficial classes i've ever taken, just because it helped me get more familiar with technology. This particular project we had to create a website from scratch using html and Github. I decided to make it about my art because at the time I was doing commission pieces and I decided that it would be a great way to showcase some of my more recent pieces. This project even helped me create this website. Click on the Athens,Ga watercolor below to access this project!
