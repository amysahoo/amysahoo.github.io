### Get to Know Me
I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelors in Buisness Administration. My area of focus is in Risk Management, but I also obtained a communications minor. My hobbies include hiking with my dog, tennis, reading, painting, and tactile crafts such as rug- making and embroidery. I spend a lot of my free time volunteering in my community in programs such as Best Buddies, Special Olympics, Nuci's Space, and the public library.
